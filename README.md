# Howdy! I'm WBanden! 
I'm not currently a programmer at the moment, but i'd like to have free time to have my own laptop.

Sure, i did had a laptop before, but it wasn't mine exactly.

# Now, about me:
## I like games, such as:
- The Coffin of Andy and Leyley.
- VrChat.
- Steam Games.

# Projects?
## Sure, i have a project in mind:
- LatinoForos (Project about a mexican forum with its own features.)
